Example of dynamically adding videos in tabs in quarto

When I create HTML using quarto videos within are correctly displayed. When I send it to the colleague (alongside folder created by quarto) he can't run videos because created subclips are saved locally on my PC. Is it possible to somehow automatically include these subclips within quarto folders so that they can be reproduced on other machines?
